# Given an array arr[] of integers, 
# find out the maximum difference between any two elements 
# such that larger element appears after the smaller number.

# Example 1:
# [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1]
# 10-2 = 8
# The maximum difference is between 10 and 2.

# Example 2:
# [7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]
# 9-7 = 2

# Example 3:
# [1, 2, 90, 10, 110]
# 110-1 = 109

# Example 4:
# [80, 2, 6, 3, 100]
# 100-2 = 98
